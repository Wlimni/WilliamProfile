# Gallery Photos

This folder should contain your personal photos for the gallery section.

## Photo Guidelines

### Recommended Specs:
- **Resolution**: At least 1000px width
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: Keep under 500KB each for fast loading
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) or landscape (16:9) work best

### Naming Convention:
- Use descriptive names: `sunset-mountains.jpg`, `team-meeting.jpg`, `coffee-with-friends.jpg`
- Or simple numbers: `photo1.jpg`, `photo2.jpg`, etc.

### Categories:
The gallery supports three categories:
- **travel**: Photos from your trips and adventures
- **work**: Professional photos, conferences, workplace moments

### How to Add Photos:

1. **Add image files** to this folder with the names above

           src: 'assets/images/gallery/photo1.jpg',
           alt: 'Your photo description',
           category: 'travel', // or 'work' or 'personal'
           caption: 'Tell the story behind this photo'

### Tips:
- Use high-quality photos that represent you well

Remember to replace all placeholder content with your actual photos!
